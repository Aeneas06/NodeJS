# Node.js Learning Repository 🚀

Welcome to the **Node.js Learning Repo** – a structured, hands-on journey from the **basics to advanced** topics in Node.js. This repository is versioned by branches, each representing an evolutionary step in building real-world Node.js applications.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo exists to:
- Learn Node.js fundamentals in-depth.
- Build real apps incrementally, from scratch to production-ready.
- Understand best practices in structure, error handling, async ops, testing, and performance.
- Version your learning journey and experiments cleanly with branches.

## 🗂️ Branch Structure

Each branch represents a progressive version of an application or concept build:

| Branch      | Description                             |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `Appv1`     | Basic HTTP server using core Node.js    |
| `Appv2-Dyno`| Node.js integrated with Gemini AI       |
| `Appv3`     | Integration of rate limiting and swagger|

> Note: Each branch is independent. You can clone and test any version directly.
